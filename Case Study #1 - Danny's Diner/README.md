## Question and Solution

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT
  s.customer_id,
  SUM(m.price) AS total_amount
FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m
  ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY total_amount DESC
````
#### Steps
- Use **INNER JOIN** to merge `dannys_diner.sales` & `dannys_diner.menu` tables through their `product_id` column.
- Use **SUM** to calculate total sales by each customer.
- Group the aggregated results by `s.customer_id`.
- Sort by `total_amount` in descending order to see which customers have spent the most.

#### Answer
| customer_id | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

- Customer A spent **$76**.
- Customer B spent **$74**.
- Customer C spent **$36**.
***

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT
  customer_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS days_visited
FROM dannys_diner.sales
GROUP BY customer_id
````
#### Steps
- Use **COUNT** to count the number of days visited, but here it is important to apply the **DISTINCT** keyword to avoid duplicating the count of a day in which the customer has visited the establishment more than once.
- Group the aggregated results by `customer_id`.

#### Answer
| customer_id | days_visited |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A           | 4            |
| B           | 6            |
| C           | 2            |

- Customer A visited the restaurant for **4** days.
- Customer B visited the restaurant for **6** days.
- Customer C visited the restaurant for **2** days.
***

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**

````sql
WITH ranking_by_date AS(
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    product_id,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER( PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date ASC) AS rk
  FROM dannys_diner.sales
)

SELECT 
  rd.customer_id,
  m.product_name
FROM ranking_by_date AS rd
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m
  ON rd.product_id = m.product_id
WHERE rk = 1
````
#### Steps
- Create a Common Table Expression **(CTE)** called `ranking_by_date`, inside this cte we create a new column `rk` and calculate the row number using ROW_NUMBER() windows function.
- Out of the CTE, in the other query select the relevant columns, then filter in the **WHERE** clause by the `rk` column where the rows are equal to 1, which represents the first row after partitioning by `rd.customer_id`.

#### Answer
| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A           | sushi        |
| B           | curry        |
| C           | ramen        |

- Customer A bought **sushi** for the first time.
- Customer B bought **curry** for the first time.
- Customer C bought **ramen** for the first time.
***

**4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**

````sql
SELECT
  m.product_name,
  COUNT(s.product_id) AS times_purchased
FROM dannys_diner.menu AS m
LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.sales AS s
  ON m.product_id = s.product_id
GROUP BY m.product_name
ORDER BY times_purchased DESC
````
#### Steps
- Use **COUNT** aggregation function on `s.product_id` to get the number of times a product was purchased, and **ORDER BY** our created column `times_purchased` in descending order.
- At this point I decided not to add **LIMIT 1** at the end of the query, which would allow us to see only the most purchased product **(ramen -> 8)**, I left it like this to see the subsequent products.

#### Answer
| product_name | times_purchased |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| ramen        | 8               |
| curry        | 4               |
| sushi        | 3               |

- Ramen is the most purchased item on the menu with 8 times purchased.
- In second place curry wih 4 times purchased.
- In third place sushi wih 3 times purchased.
***

**5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**

````sql
WITH ranking_items AS(
  SELECT
    s.customer_id,
    m.product_name,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY COUNT(s.product_id) DESC) AS rk
  FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m
    ON s.product_id = m.product_id
  GROUP BY s.customer_id, m.product_name
)

SELECT 
  customer_id,
  product_name
FROM ranking_items
WHERE rk = 1
````
#### Steps
- Create a CTE called `ranking_items`, join the tables `dannys_diner.sales` and `dannys_diner.menu` by the common column `product_id`.
- Group results by `customer_id` and `product_name`.
- Create the `rk` column in which we will partition by `customer_id` and calculate the count with the `product_id` column for each guy, these results are sorted in descending order.
- Out of the CTE, in the other query select the relevant columns, then filter in the WHERE clause by the `rk` column where the rows are equal to 1.

#### Answer
| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A           | ramen        |
| B           | sushi        |
| C           | ramen        |

- Customer A loves ramen.
- Customer B loves sushi.
- Customer C loves ramen.
***

**6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**

````sql
WITH cte AS(
  SELECT
    s.customer_id,
    s.product_id,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date ASC) AS rk
  FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.members AS m
    ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
  WHERE s.order_date >= m.join_date
)
,
joining_the_item AS(
  SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    m.product_name 
  FROM cte AS c
  LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m
    ON c.product_id = m.product_id
  WHERE rk = 1
)

SELECT 
  * 
FROM joining_the_item
ORDER BY customer_id ASC
````
#### Steps
- Create 2 CTE, `cte` in which we rank the items and it does exactly the same as in the above problem, the difference is that we filter with a condition `(s.order_date >= m.join_date)` in where clause to get only the items purchased when the customer became a member.
- In CTE `joining_the_item` join the tables `cte` and `dannys_diner.menu`, then filter in WHERE clause by the column `rk` where the rows are equal to 1, select the desired columns.
- In the outer query order the results by `customer_id` column in ascending order.

>**Note:** I know that this particular case can be done exactly the same as case #5, but I am practicing what can be done with CTE's.

#### Answer
| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A           | curry        |
| B           | sushi        |

- Customer A purchased curry after he became a member.
- Customer B purchased sushi after he became a member.

***

**7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**

````sql
WITH ranking_by_date AS(
  SELECT
    s.customer_id,
    s.order_date,
    menu.product_name,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date DESC) AS rk
  FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
  LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.Members AS m
    ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
  LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu 
    ON s.product_id = menu.product_id
  WHERE s.order_date < m.join_date
  ORDER BY menu.product_name ASC
)

SELECT 
  customer_id,
  product_name
FROM ranking_by_date
WHERE rk = 1
````
#### Steps
- Create a CTE called `ranking_by_date`, select the relevant columns, create a new column `rk` and calculate the row number using the windows function **DENSE_RANK()** as it ranks us without leaving gaps between rows.
- Join the tables `dannys_diner.sales` and `dannys_diner.Members` through `customer_id` column.
- Join the tables `dannys_diner.sales` and `dannys_diner.menu` through `product_id` column.
- Filter with a condition `(s.order_date < m.join_date)` in where clause.
- Sort the results by `menu.product_name` in ascending order.

#### Answer
| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A           | curry        |
| A           | sushi        |
| B           | sushi        |

- Customer A purchased curry & sushi the same day before he became a member.
- Customer B purchased sushi before he became a member.

**8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**

````sql
SELECT
  s.customer_id,
  COUNT(s.*) AS items_bought,
  SUM(menu.price) AS total_amount_spent
FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu 
  ON s.product_id = menu.product_id
LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.Members AS m
  ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
WHERE s.order_date < m.join_date
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id ASC
````
#### Steps
- Select `customer_id` column, calculate the count with `s.*`, or if you want to be more specific use `s.product_id` to get the total purchases as items_bought and calculate the sum of `menu.price` as total_amount_spent.
- Join the tables `dannys_diner.sales` and `dannys_diner.menu` through `s.product_id` column.
- Join the tables `dannys_diner.sales` and `dannys_diner.Members` through `s.customer_id` column.
- Filter with a condition `(s.order_date < m.join_date)` in where clause.
- Group results by `s.customer_id` column.
- Sort the results by `s.customer_id` in ascending order.

#### Answer
| customer_id | items_bought | total_amount_spent |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| A           | 2            | 25                 |
| B           | 3            | 40                 |

- Customer A bought 2 items and spent $25 before he became a member.
- Customer B bought 3 items and spent $40 before he became a member.
***

**9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?**

````sql
SELECT
  s.customer_id,
  SUM(
    CASE 
      WHEN m.product_name = 'sushi' THEN m.price * 20
      ELSE m.price * 10
    END
  ) AS user_points
FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m
  ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY user_points DESC
````
#### Steps
Let's break down the question to understand the point about how to calculate the points for each user.
- Each $1 spent = 10 points, in the case of the **sushi** product you get 2x points, so $1 spent = 20 points.
- Here's how the calculation is performed using a conditional **CASE statement**:
	- If `product_id = 'sushi'`, multiply every $1 by 20 points.
	- Otherwise, multiply $1 by 10 points.
- Then calculates the sum of the user_points for each user

#### Answer
| customer_id | user_points  |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| B           | 940          |
| A           | 860          |
| C           | 360          |

- Customer B is the highest point user with 940 points.
- Customer A have 860 points.
- Customer C have 360 points.
***

**10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?**

````sql
WITH members_week AS (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    join_date,
    join_date + 6 AS complete_week
  FROM dannys_diner.members
)

SELECT
  s.customer_id,
  SUM(CASE
        WHEN s.order_date BETWEEN mw.join_date AND mw.complete_week  THEN menu.price * 20
        ELSE menu.price * 10
      END) AS user_points
FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu 
  ON s.product_id = menu.product_id
LEFT JOIN members_week AS mw
  ON s.customer_id = mw.customer_id
WHERE s.order_date >= mw.join_date
  AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM s.order_date) = 1
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY user_points DESC
````
#### Understanding the problem
- Day 1-7 the client becomes a member, each $1 spent = 20 on all items.
- Day 8 to the last day of January, each $1 spent = 10 on all items.
  
#### Steps
- Create a CTE called `members_week`, calculate `complete_week` by adding 6 days to join_date 
- Join the tables `dannys_diner.sales` and `dannys_diner.menu` through `s.product_id` column.
- Join the tables `dannys_diner.sales` and `members_week` through `mw.customer_id` column.
- Filter with a condition `(s.order_date >= mw.join_date)` in where clause to ensure that the date of purchase is the same day or after he has become a member and filter by January month `EXTRACT(MONTH FROM s.order_date) = 1`
- Then calculates the sum of `user_points` for each user
- Group results by `s.customer_id` column.
- Sort the results by `user_points` in descending order.

#### Answer
| customer_id | user_points |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 1020        |
| B           | 320         |

- Customer A is the highest point user with 1020 points in January.
- Customer B have 320 points.

### Bonus Question
* **Join all the things and crecreate the table with_ customer_id, order_date, product_name, price, member (Y/N)**
* **Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.**
````sql
WITH Dannys_diner_table AS(
  SELECT
    s.customer_id,
    s.order_date,
    menu.product_name,
    menu.price,
    CASE WHEN s.order_date >= m.join_date THEN 'Y' ELSE 'N' END AS member
  FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
  LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu
    ON s.product_id = menu.product_id
  LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.Members AS m

  CASE
    WHEN member = 'N' THEN NULL
    ELSE ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id, member ORDER BY order_date)
  END AS ranking
