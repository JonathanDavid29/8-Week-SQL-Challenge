## Business Task
Danny was enthusiastic about his pizza business idea, recognizing that pizza sales alone wouldn't secure the funding he needed to grow his Pizza Empire. To enhance his strategy, he decided to "Uberize" it,
leading to the launch of Pizza Runner. Despite maxing out his credit card to hire freelance developers for a mobile app, he now seeks assistance in cleaning data and performing basic calculations to optimize 
Pizza Runner's operations, using the entity relationship diagram he's prepared.

## üßΩ Data Cleaning & Transformation

### üõ†Ô∏è Table: customer_orders.

Looking at table `customer_orders`, we can see that there are some irregularities:
- `exclusion` column, there are missing values, blanks and null values.
- `extras` column, there are missing values, blanks and null values.

Steps:
- Create a temporary table with all the columns.
- Remove null values in `exlusions` and `extras` columns and replace with blank space ' '.

````sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE customer_orders_temp AS
SELECT
  order_id,
  customer_id,
  pizza_id,
  CASE 
    WHEN exclusions IS null OR exclusions LIKE '%null%' THEN ' '
    ELSE exclusions
  END AS exclusions,
  CASE 
    WHEN extras IS null OR extras LIKE '%null%' OR extras LIKE '%NaN%' THEN ' '
    ELSE extras
  END AS extras,
  order_time
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;

### üõ†Ô∏è Table: runner_orders.

Looking at table `runner_orders`, we can see that there are some irregularities:
- `pickup_time` column, there are null values.
- `distance` column, there are missing values, null values and in some of the rows incorporates the length measurement **km**.
- `duration` column, there are missing values, null values and in some of the rows incorporates the time measurement as **mins/mins/minutes**.
- `cancellation` column, there are missing values, blanks and null values.

Steps:
- Create a temporary table with all the columns.
- Remove null values in `pickup_time` column and replace with blank space ' '.
- Remove null values, 'km' in `distance` column and replace with blank space ' '.
- Remove null values, 'mins/mins/minutes'  in `duration` column and replace with blank space ' '.
- Remove null values in `cancellation` column and replace with blank space ' '.

````sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE runner_orders_temp AS
SELECT
  order_id,
  runner_id,
  CASE 
    WHEN pickup_time IS null OR pickup_time LIKE '%null%' THEN ' '
    ELSE pickup_time
  END AS pickup_time,
  CASE 
    WHEN distance IS null OR distance LIKE '%null%' THEN ' '
    WHEN distance LIKE '%km' THEN TRIM('km' FROM distance)
    ELSE distance 
  END AS distance,
  CASE
    WHEN duration IS null OR duration LIKE '%null%' THEN ' '
    WHEN duration LIKE '%mins' THEN TRIM('mins' FROM duration)
    WHEN duration LIKE '%minute' THEN TRIM('minute' FROM duration)
    WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes' THEN TRIM('minutes' FROM duration)
    ELSE duration
  END AS duration,
  CASE 
    WHEN cancellation IS null OR cancellation LIKE '%null%' OR cancellation LIKE '%NaN%' THEN ' '
    ELSE cancellation
  END AS cancellation
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders;

Let's alter the data type of the columns `pickup_time`, `distance` and `duration`.

````sql
ALTER TABLE runner_orders1
ALTER COLUMN distance TYPE double precision USING distance::integer,
ALTER COLUMN duration TYPE INT USING duration::integer,
ALTER COLUMN pickup_time TYPE timestamp USING pickup_time::timestamp WITHOUT time zone;
````
